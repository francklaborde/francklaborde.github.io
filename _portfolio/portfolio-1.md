title: "Neurogenesis"
excerpt: "A notebook detailing the dynamic nature of neural networks through the adaptation of their structure by modifying the number of neurons and connections. This adaptability can be achieved through two distinct processes: pruning, which involves the removal of redundant or non-contributory neurons to enhance efficiency, and neurogenesis, which enables the model to introduce new neurons when the current architecture is insufficient to capture the complexity of the information. <br/><img src='/images/nn.jpg'>"
