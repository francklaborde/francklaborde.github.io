Hi, I’m Franck ! I am a student in the Mathématiques Vision Apprentissage (MVA) Master's program at ENS Paris-Saclay, specializing in computer vision, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. I explore a lot of domain linked to those domain and I am looking forward to work in this domain !

## What I Do

I have a deep interest in the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and research. My recent projects include:
- Improving neural network architectures through dynamic neural network ([View project](https://francklaborde.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1)).
- Exploring the advantages of generative classifier over discrimative ones when adversarial attacks are performed on a model ([View project](https://francklaborde.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2)).
